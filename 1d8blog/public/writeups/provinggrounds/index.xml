      <description>Despite the name, this is not a Domain Controller and is indeed a Linux box!
Starting off with a quick nmap scan of the box:
We see 3 services running on the box:
 22 - SSH 80 - HTTP 111 - RPCBind  What really caught my attention was port 80 since it&amp;rsquo;s running Drupal, which is an open-source Content Management System (CMS) and nmap is telling us that it&amp;rsquo;s running version 7 of Drupal which has an SQL injection vulnerability that was dubbed Drupalgeddon!</description>
