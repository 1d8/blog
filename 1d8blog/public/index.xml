      <description>Description: Investigating Git commits for sensitive data
TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s Committed - https://tryhackme.com/room/committed
For this challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re given an Ubuntu machine and told that sensitive data, aka our flag, has been committed to a Github repository, but it is unknown where the exact file location that the data was committed to. Our task is to find this sensitive data using git!
With git, every commit is logged and gets a commit ID which is a long hash-like string.</description>

      <description>Description: Analyzing the logs of a compromised Wordpress site Log Analysis Compromised Wordpress - https://blueteamlabs.online/home/challenge/9
In this challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re given a log file and told that it belongs to a Wordpress site which was compromised. The way in which the site was compromised is unknown, but it&amp;rsquo;s suspected that an installed plugin was vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and an attacker exploited this to gain access.

      <description>CVE-2021-29011 (XSS)
There are several features of the radius manager software that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (xss). Successful exploitation requires that you have access to the Radius Management software web interface and be logged in or have an account with sufficient privileges for adding/editing certain items (such as adding users, access points, etc).
This may be used as a means to elevate privileges when chained together with CVE-2021-29012 since a low-privilege account is required.</description>

      <description>CVE-2021-29012 (Broken Session Management)
When an admin user logs in, their session cookie is given &amp;amp; doesn&amp;rsquo;t expire upon logging out. Instead the session cookie is temporarily disabled until the admin logs in again. The session cookie doesn&amp;rsquo;t change so if an attacker manages to steal a session cookie, then they can simply reuse it when the admin is logged in again and impersonate them. And if they aren&amp;rsquo;t successful at logging in the first time due to the admin being logged out, they can simply keep trying until the admin is logged in again and get a successful login.</description>

CSRF - Creating Access Points This exploit requires an attacker to have access to the web interface of the RADIUS Manager but an account isn&amp;rsquo;t required (instead, this CSRF can be exploited in order to create an account for the attacker.). It also requires the victim to browse to our custom crafted webpage &amp;amp; be already logged in as a RADIUS user with the appropriate privileges for the certain action we want them to execute (EX: If we want the victim&amp;rsquo;s account to create a new user account for us, the victim must be logged in as someone with sufficient privileges that allows them to create an account).</description>

Insecure Service Permissions When it comes to this vulnerability, we&amp;rsquo;re simply modifying the service so it points to an executable we want to run along with the parameters to run with it! The reason why this is possible is because excessive privileges have been granted to modify a service, such as allowing everybody to modify it or allowing lower privilege users to modify it.</description>

Our first task is to find the username of the attacker and we are given a .svg image file which tend to contain a trove of data that could be read just by viewing the source of the file!
Line 20 of the source of the .svg file gives us the full filepath of the image, including the attacker&amp;rsquo;s username: SakuraSnowAngelAiko:</description>

      <description>Starting off with an nmap scan for the box: nmap -sV -sC 10.10.11.224:
We see that there&amp;rsquo;s 3 ports opened:
 22 - SSH 80 - HTTP 55555 - Unknown  SSH is usually not a port to focus on when it comes to HTB machines, and port 80 is being filtered so we likely will not be able to access it. So let&amp;rsquo;s focus our efforts on this unknown service running on port 55555.</description>

      <description>Description: Using Volatility to perform memory analysis on a memory dump of a CentOS Linux machine Seized - https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/92
In this challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re given a zip file which contains dump.mem along with another zip file named Centos7.3.10.1062.zip. The CentOS zip file is the profile that is necessary in order to use volatility with the Linux memory dump.
The challenge description states:
&amp;ldquo;Using Volatility, utilize your memory analysis skills to Investigate the provided Linux memory snapshots and figure out attack details.</description>

In this challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re given 3 memory dump files totaling 3.2 GB in size:
 Snapshot6.vmem Snapshot14.vmem Snapshot19.vmem  I will be using remnux&amp;rsquo;s virtual machine to solve these tasks along with the volatility memory analysis tool!
Task 2 In our second task, we&amp;rsquo;re given Snapshot6.vmem and asked to find John&amp;rsquo;s password.
The first step from all these tasks that I took is identifying the correct memory profile to use with volatility which can be done via:</description>
