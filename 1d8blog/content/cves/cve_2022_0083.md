# Description

When resetting your password, you're able to enumerate users based on the way that the server responds to your request. If you enter an email that doesn't exist (for example: test@gmail.com), then the server will respond with an HTTP 302 FOUND status response code (indicated by line 97 of the occurrence link)

But if you attempt to reset the password for an account that you know exists (for example: remdex@gmail.com), then the server will respond with an HTTP 200 OK status response code and also responds with this page which indicates that a password reset email was sent (indicated by line 94 of the occurrence link)

# Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to /site_admin/user/forgotpassword
2. Enter an email address that doesn't exist (For example: 1d8demo@gmail.com)
3. Observe network requests & restore password. Notice that it is a 302 redirect to the forgotpassword page which indicates the email address doesn't exist
4. Now enter an email address that does exist (For example: remdex@gmail.com)
5. Observe the network request & restore password. Notice how the server responds with a different webpage which indicates that a password reminder email has been sent, confirming that the email address does exist.
